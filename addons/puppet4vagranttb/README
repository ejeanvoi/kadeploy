HOWTO

1/ Update addons/puppet4vagranttb/modules/kadeploy/files/sample-cluster.conf
You have to update the hard reboot command in order to use the correct user. Indeed kadeploy_master VM will have connect to the host in order to perform the reboot command via vboxmanage. Furthermore, on the host side, you have to add addons/ssh/id_deploy.pub to your authorized_keys (another key can be used but you will have to update also addons/puppet4vagranttb/modules/kadeploy/files/reboot.sh)

2/ Connect into the kadeploy_master VM
$> cd $KADEPLOY_ROOT_DIR
$> vagrant up
$> vagrant ssh kadeploy_master

3/ Become root and try to deploy
$> sudo su -
$> kadeploy3 -e wheezy-min -m node-1
