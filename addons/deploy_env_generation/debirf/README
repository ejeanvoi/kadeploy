Deployment kernel generation based on Debirf (http://cmrg.fifthhorseman.net/wiki/debirf).

There are some issues with non-root builds, since they involve many tricks
using fakeroot. (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=680235
for example). Therefore we generate the image as root (using debirf make -r).
